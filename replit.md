# System Architecture

## Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **Routing**: Wouter.
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query.
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a "liquid glass" aesthetic.
- **Build Tool**: Vite.

## Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript.
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM.
- **Authentication**: bcrypt for password hashing; session-based authentication (PostgreSQL for persistence).
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints.

## Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon Database.
- **Storage Implementation**: DbStorage class with Drizzle ORM.
- **Schema Design**: User-centric with tables for users, progress, essays, ENEM competency fields, structures, materials, subscription plans, and analytics.
- **Migration Management**: Drizzle Kit.

## Development
- **Monorepo Structure**: `client/`, `server/`, and `shared/` directories.
- **Shared Code**: Common TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas.

## Design System
- **Color Palette**: Custom CSS variables for DissertIA brand colors (dark blue, bright blue, soft gray).
- **Typography**: Inter font family.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind.

## Technical Implementations
- **AI-powered Features**: Socratic Argument Architect, Intelligent Repertoire Explorer, personalized structure creators, AI essay generation, AI chat (with enhanced pedagogical guidance), and professional essay correction with competency analysis.
- **Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive AI feature rate limiting to manage costs based on subscription plans (Free, Pro Monthly, Pro Yearly).
- **Profile Management**: User profile update with Brazilian phone validation.
- **Competency Analysis**: "Pontos a Melhorar" feature displaying dynamic competency cards based on user essay data.
- **Dynamic Goal Management**: Smart goal setting system for target scores.
- **User Score Tracking**: System for tracking user scores from various sources, with dashboard visualization and manual entry.
- **Save to Library Feature**: Users can save modified texts from the Writing Controller to a personal library.
- **Subscription Management**: Automatic user subscription lifecycle management (default to free, automatic upgrades via Stripe webhooks, automatic downgrades for expired subscriptions) with persistent session storage in PostgreSQL.
- **Stripe Integration**: Uses pre-configured Stripe Price IDs for monthly and annual plans.
- **Database Auto-Initialization**: Automatic creation of subscription plans on first server start via db-init.ts.
- **Admin Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) system with isAdmin field in users table. Backend protected with requireAdmin middleware on all admin routes. Frontend protected with useAdminCheck hook on all admin pages (dashboard, newsletter, coupons, materials).
- **User Management System**: Admin dashboard with separate tabs for "UsuÃ¡rios" (user management) and "Administradores" (admin management). Multi-select functionality with checkboxes allows bulk deletion of user accounts. Endpoint POST /api/admin/users/delete-multiple safely deletes multiple users with transaction-based cascading deletion, preventing admins from deleting their own accounts. Both tabs feature real-time search filtering by name, email, phone, and plan with results counter and clear button.
- **Subscription Prompt System**: Popup dialog displayed to free-tier users after signup and every login, encouraging upgrade to Pro plan. Uses useEffect-based state management to react to authentication changes, ensuring correct display timing. Dialog presents Pro benefits and offers choices to upgrade or continue with free plan.
- **Intelligent Repertoire Generation**: Automatic AI-powered repertoire generation when search returns no results. System detects empty search results and automatically triggers Gemini API to create relevant repertoires based on search query and filters. Features visual loading state with Sparkles icon and "Gerando repertÃ³rios personalizados..." message. Smart flag management prevents infinite loops and allows manual retries. Robust JSON parsing with recovery logic handles truncated Gemini responses by preserving complete objects and ensuring proper array closure.
- **Mobile-Optimized Repertoire Display**: Expandable description feature for repertoire cards on mobile devices. Long descriptions (>90 chars) show truncated text with "Ver mais"/"Ver menos" toggle button, allowing users to read full content without overwhelming small screens.
- **Simulator Information Card**: Informational card on simulator page guides users to track their evolution via Dashboard and reminds them that all simulation data is automatically saved to their Personal Library.
- **Plan Management System**: Pro users (monthly and annual) have access to "Gerenciar Plano" button replacing individual upgrade/cancel buttons. Centralized dialog provides cancellation option for all Pro users and upgrade to annual option exclusively for monthly subscribers. System correctly identifies paid plans via priceMonthly or priceYearly validation, ensuring proper access control.
- **Immediate Subscription Cancellation**: Cancellation system immediately stops Stripe billing and downgrades user to free plan. If Stripe cancellation fails, the system aborts the downgrade and returns clear error message to prevent billing inconsistencies. Users are notified that cancellation is immediate, not at period end.
- **Unique Outline Titles**: System enforces unique titles for saved outlines in user's personal library. Backend validation checks for duplicate titles before saving (returns 409 status). Frontend validates before submission and shows clear error messages. "Salvar na Biblioteca" button is disabled after successful save and displays "Salvo na Biblioteca". State resets when new outline is generated, allowing save of each newly created outline only once.
- **Text Length Control System**: Dynamic text size control using slider (50%-200% of original length) replacing previous formality system. Users can control output size independently of word complexity. Backend prompts adjust instructions based on percentage: <80% for summarization, >120% for expansion, ~100% for rewriting. Frontend slider provides visual feedback with labels "Menor (50%)", "Original (100%)", "Maior (200%)". Maintains word difficulty selector (simples/medio/complexo) alongside size control.
- **Library File Limits for Free Plan**: Free-tier users limited to 20 accessible files in Personal Library across 7 active categories (repertÃ³rios, propostas, textos modificados, roteiros, brainstormings, simulados, redaÃ§Ãµes). Backend helper function `applyLibraryLimits` retrieves all library types, combines and sorts by savedAt date (oldest first), marks first 20 as accessible and remaining as locked. Frontend always displays file counter banner for free users showing "X de 20 arquivos" with color-coded visual feedback (blue: normal use, yellow: near limit â‰¥15 files, red: has locked files). System displays ðŸ”’ "Bloqueado" badge on locked files, disables view/download buttons, and shows upgrade dialog when accessing locked content. Pro users (monthly/annual) have unlimited library access. Security fix: GET /api/simulations enforces userId from session to prevent cross-user data leakage. Duplicate prevention: both repertoires and proposals endpoints detect already-saved items and return alreadySaved flag with informative toast messages.
- **Dual Cost Tracking System**: All AI operations record costs in two separate tables: (1) `weekly_usage` for rate limiting and weekly budget control, and (2) `user_costs` for admin analytics and historical tracking. The chat argumentative endpoint now correctly tracks costs via `costTrackingService.trackAIOperation()` alongside `weeklyCostLimitingService.recordAIOperation()`. Cost field `costBrl` stores values in centavos (1 centavo = R$ 0.01), with display formatting handling conversion to BRL (R$ X.XX). Small costs (1-2 centavos) may display as R$ 0.00 due to `.toFixed(2)` rounding, but actual centavo values are accurately stored and accumulated in database.
